# Galactic-Halls
Hall of Memories Script.
Requires a Divination level of 70 to use.
Will automatically collect and fill jars so you don't have to.
Having Memory strands can be useful to getting there before you start, as they act as a teleport right outside the Halls.
NOTE - I DID NOT CREATE THIS SCRIPT JUST EDITED, CHANGED, AND ADDED FUNCTIONS TO THE ORIGNAL CREATORS VERSION (Unknown)
